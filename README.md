Its a basic Frogger type game where you try to avoid the big bugs and make it to the water to score points.
	*The Object of the game is to get your character sprite to the water as many times as you can.
	*Use the arrow keys on your keyboard to move your sprite.  left, right, up, down.
    *If you come in contact with a bug you lose a life
    *If you make it to the water you regenerate at the bottom of the screen, and your level goes up by 1. Your score goes up by 50pts.
    *Gems randomly appear once you reach level 3. Each gem you collect will get you 50 additional points.
    *Every level increases the chance of a bug going faster.  The higher you go the faster bugs may appear on the screen. Watch out for Level 15(its crazy fast)

 Make sure you click the screen to get the game started.


 Im a new programmer and the games has lots of obvious bug but I learned a lot and to be honest, one month ago there is no way in the world I would ever think I could make something liket this.
